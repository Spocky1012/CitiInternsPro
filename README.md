Favorite Places to Travel to in Jacksonville, Florida
1. Abandoned Annie Lytle Elementary School: an old schoolhouse that was built in the 1920's that soon became abandoned in the 1960's. The elementary school has many urban legends surrouding it and the mysterous fire in the east wing that lead to the school's shut down. Many locals claim that the janitor took kids down into the boiler room and burned them alive, until one escaped and blowing up the boiler room in the process, causing the east wing to catch fire.

2. 927 Building on Forsyth Street: an old building that is now completely covered in paintings on all four sides of the building. The murals contain seven people that are composed of geometric shapes with the heads of chickens. The murals are full of vibrant blues and purples.

3. The Arts Market in Riverside: An arts market that occurs every saturday in the early morning until the late afternoon. Vendors and local artists from all over jacksonville come to sell their goods and food at the art market. The market is also held alongside the St.Johns River
