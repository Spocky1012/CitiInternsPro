		<h3><u>Hannah's Favorite Places:</u></h3>
		<h4>1.) Walter Jones Historic Park</h4>
			<p>
				Walter Jones Historic Park has a bunch of old bulidings that belonged <br>to Walter 
				Jones as well as a school that were donated to the Mandarin <br>Historical Society 
				to keep preserved. During the weekday you can take <br>tours of the buildings and learn 
				about the history of Mandarin. There is <br>also a butterfly garden and beautiful trails 
				as well as a close by boat <br>dock and beautiful trees that make you forget you are in 
				the suburbs. It <br> is a great place to go on a pinic with friends and it is a hidden gem in 
				the city. 
			</p>

		<h4>2.) The Avenues</h4>
			<p>
				The Avenues mall is a great place to go to hang out with friends and get your shopping 
				done. <br>It has tons of stores to make sure everyone can find things that they like and 
				there is a pretty killer food court too. It is just a great place to hang out or get 
				some retail therapy in.

			</p>
			<img src="fox.png" alt="The logo of the restaurant" class="img left" align="bottom"/>
		<h4>Favorite Restaurant: The Fox Restaurant</h4>	
		<p>The Fox, aka Fox's, is a local restaurant that has a sense of community <br>and makes 
			you feel like you are just apart of the family. They have the<br> best breakfast in town 
			and are always super nice. 10/10 recommend, <br>it is always worth the drive and worth the 
			wait. Remember eat local!</p>			
		<h6><u>Zaina's Favrotie Places:</u></h6>
		<img src="creppy 1.png" alt="A photo of the boiler room" class="img left" align= "left"/>
		<img src="creepy 2.png" alt="a photo of the entrance to the school" class="img left" align= "left"/>
		<h5>1.) Abandoned Annie Lytle Elementary School</h5>	
			<p align="right">
				It is an old schoolhouse that was built in the 1920's that soon <br> became 
				abandoned in the 1960's. The elementary school has <br>many urban legends 
				surrounding it and the mysterious fire in<br> the east wing that led to the school's 
				shut down. Many locals<br> claim that the janitor took kids down into the boiler room
				and <br>burned them alive, until one escaped and blew up the boiler <br>room in the process,
				causing the east wing to catch fire.
			</p>
			<img src="gay.png" alt="A photo of the art" class="img left" align="left"/>
		<h5>2.) 927 Building on Forsyth Street</h5>
			<p align="right">
				It is an old building that is now completely covered in paintings<br> on all four 
				sides of the building. The murals contain seven people <br>that are composed of geometric
			    shapes with the heads of chickens. <br>The murals are full of vibrant blues and purples.
			</p>
		<h5>3.) The Arts Market in Riverside</h5>
		<img src="RAM.png" alt="A phot of the Riverside Arts Market" class="img left" align="left"/>
			<p align="right">
				An arts market that occurs every Saturday in the early morning <br>until the late afternoon. 
				Vendors and local artists from all over<br> jacksonville come to sell their goods and food
			    at the art market.<br> The market is also held alongside the St. Johns River
			</p>
		<h5>Favorite Restaurant: Kim’s Korean Barbeque</h5>	
			<p align="right">
				 It is run by Papa and Mama Kim. Papa Kim used to serve in the Korean<br> military before
				 moving to the U.S. where he then served in the army here. <br>The restaurant has a 
				 cozy atmosphere as it is run by the Kim Family only. You<br>can find Kpop (korean pop 
				 music) playing on all TV’s within the dining area.<br> Each table has a mini grill used 
				 to cook the meat yourself.
