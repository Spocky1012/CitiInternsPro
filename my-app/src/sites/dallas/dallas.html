		<h3><u>Afrah's Favorite Places:</u></h3>
		<h4>1.) Mandalay Canal</h4>
			<p>
				Mandalay Canal is a really fancy lakeside canal, that you can walk around<br> and 
				enjoy the scenic views. It has a waterfall and little shops along the way,<br> where
				you can stop and enjoy some drinks. They also have gondola rides <br>that you can 
				enjoy. It’s a very romantic place, that you should visit if you’re<br> ever in the 
				Dallas area. I have gone here many times, with friends and family.<br> This place is 
				memorable for me because I took my graduation pictures here.

		<h4>2.) Highland Park</h4>
			<p>
				Highland Park is known to be the richest neighborhood in Dallas, it is lined <br>
				with mansions costing millions of dollars with some of the coolest architecture.<br> 
				This is my go-to place to take friends and family if they’re visiting, to drive <br>
				around. The community park here is also a must-visit. It stretches across a lake <br>and 
				is conveniently named ‘Lakeside Park’. They have rare flowers and cotton trees <br>that 
				you can sit under and enjoy a picnic. 
			</p>

		<h4>3.) Klyde Warren Park</h4>
			<p>
				This is a huge park in the middle of downtown that is surrounded by buildings <br>and 
				gives a very downtown feel. They have restaurants and coffee places to sit<br> and enjoy.
				The park is especially beautiful during Christmas time, as they light up <br>all the trees 
				to make it feel festive. The park also has a train running around it, which<br> is free to 
				enjoy. This train takes you around the park and also shows some of the <br>cool monuments
				around town. 
			</p>
			<br>
		<img src="afrah.png" alt="The logo of the resturant" class="img left" align="right"/>
		<h4>Favorite Restaurant: Afrah</h4>	
			<p>
				This is a fancy Mediterranean restaurant in Richardson, Texas. It is famous for<br> having 
				some of the best hummus in town. They have everything from grilled<br> kebabs, to falafels, 
				to give you an authentic experience. The restaurant was <br>named after me, yes, Afrah. 
				Though I do not get any commission I do love to<br> brag about it. The word Afrah means 
				Happiness in Arabic, so the restaurant <br>wants to make everyone who visits happy.

		<img src="mall.png" alt="A photo of the mall" class="img left" align= "left"/>
		<h5>1.) Galleria Mall</h5>	
			<p align="right">
				A shopping mall with lots of shops and fun activities, it is a must-visit <br> in Dallas.
				The best part of it is an ice skating rink that ties it all together!
			</p>
		<h5>2.) DFW Airport</h5>
		<img src="airport.png" alt="A photo of the airport" class="img left" align="left"/>
			<p align="right">
				The DFW airport was the 4th busiest airport in 2020, and is one of the<br> largest airports
				in the United States. Primarily, the airport is the perfect<br> place to watch flights 
				take-off and land, which gives some feeling of peace.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h5>3.) Reunion Tower </h5>
		<img src="tower.png" alt="A photo of the Reunion Tower" class="img left" align="left"/>
			<p align="right">
				Reunion Tower is a 561 ft observation tower in Dallas, Texas and one <br>of the city's 
				most recognizable landmarks. Located at the heart of <br>downtown Dallas, the tower is 
				part of the Hyatt Regency Hotel <br>complex, and is the city's 15th tallest building.
			</p>
		<h5>Favorite Restaurant:  Cosmic Cafe
		</h5>	
			<p align="right">
				The perfect restaurant to witness a blend of asian culture in the western <br>world.
				It is also one of the healthiest, vegetarian restaurants in the US, <br>and offers
				live music in a cozy environment.
